##Hello, world!

Whenever I have code that's too small to put in its own project, or if it's only one file - it goes here.
This project has stuff that calculates values in a polynomial, derives, integrates, and also emulates the Game of Life.
I hope to post more interesting stuff soon. Meanwhile, check out gecho and eos!
